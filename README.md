# Accident Prediction

- Using various Machine Learning algorithms, built a model to classify the various severity of accidents and identify as to what region had the greatest number of accidents and at what time do, they most occur. 
- Along with this, the model was also able to differentiate the number of accidents per hour and month and conclude the range of time during which most accidents occur.
